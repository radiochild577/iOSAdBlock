# iOS AdBlock list

A personal hosts file that I started creating in October 2018 for my iPhone on iOS 12. I'm usually jailbroken and use a hosts file to block ads, but I upgraded to a new iPhone that came with iOS 12 which hasn't been jailbroken yet. So I created this list to use with AdGuard Pro on iOS to block ads until an iOS 12 jailbreak is released. 


The list is a combination of the hosts files listed below, with duplicates between the two lists removed, and I also added a few custom rules myself. The rules that I added prevent iOS cert revokes (for signing service/sideloaded apps) and block ads in the Yahoo & ESPN Fantasy apps (iOS), which the lists below did not seem to catch.

To use this hosts file on iOS, install AdGuard Pro from the App Store, and add a Privacy subscription setting to the raw version of this list (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiochild577/iOSAdBlock/master/Hosts.txt).

If you come across any mobile ad servers that you would like to see included in this list, please let me know and they will be added.
