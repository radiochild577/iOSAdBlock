# iOS AdBlock list

My personal hosts file that I started creating in October 2018 for my iPhone on iOS 12. I'm usually jailbroken when one is available for my hardware and use a hosts file to block out all ads, but I upgraded to a new iPhone which came with iOS 12 (which doesn't have a jailbreak...yet!). 

This list is a combination of the two lists below, as well as a few  servers that I personally want blocked such as Apple cert revokes for sideloaded apps, ads in Yahoo/ESPN Fantasy iOS apps that the lists did not seem to block, etc.

This list is a combination of the hosts files listed below, with duplicates between the two lists removed, and I also added a few custom rules myself. The rules that I added prevent iOS cert revokes (for signing service/sideloaded apps) and block ads in the Yahoo & ESPN Fantasy apps (iOS), which the lists below did not seem to block.

To use this hosts file on iOS, install AdGuard Pro from the App Store, and add a Privacy subscription setting to the raw version of this list (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiochild577/iOSAdBlock/master/Hosts.txt).  


The host files below were used in generating this custom list:
